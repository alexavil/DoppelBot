# Why play-dl ?

[ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core) has some issues with miniget and also stream abort issues. On the other hand, [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) is a very perfect alternative but it takes time to launch. Hence, play-dl is created to avoid these issues along with providing comparatively faster performance than others.
